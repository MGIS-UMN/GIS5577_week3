First open a windows prompt, by going to the start menu and typing "cmd"

Next open find the psql file
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin

In the command prompt change the directory by typing "cd" and then the path "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin"

c:\>cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin

You should be able to type "psql" 

To connect to the server you will need to specify your host address, username, database

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin>psql -h 149.165.170.114 -U <username> -d <database>

To load the data simply add the "-c" command for copying the data into the table

"\COPY <tableName> FROM 'csvPath' WITH CSV HEADER;
-- The "\" is important 

Example of a command below
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin>psql -h 149.165.170.114 -U david -d david -c "COPY iowa_liquor_sales FROM 'C:\work\GIS5577\GIS5577_lab2\iowa_liquor_sales.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;"
